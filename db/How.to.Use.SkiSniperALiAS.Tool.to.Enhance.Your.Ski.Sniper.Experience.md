## Tips and Tricks to Improve Your Ski Sniper Skills
 
Ski Sniper is not just a game of shooting ski jumpers. It's also a game of strategy, timing and accuracy. To become the best Ski Sniper around the world, you need to master some tips and tricks that will help you achieve higher scores and complete more objectives. Here are some of them:
 
- Choose your weapon wisely. Each weapon has different characteristics, such as range, damage, reload time and bullet drop. Some weapons are better suited for certain situations than others. For example, the crossbow is silent and accurate, but has a slow reload time and a high bullet drop. The sniper rifle is powerful and fast, but has a loud sound and a low bullet drop. Experiment with different weapons and find the one that suits your style.
- Choose your sniping spot carefully. Each spot has different advantages and disadvantages, such as visibility, distance and angle. Some spots are easier to shoot from than others, but they may also expose you to more danger. For example, the ski lift is close to the jumpers and has a good angle, but it also makes you more visible to the security guards. The forest is far from the jumpers and has a bad angle, but it also provides you with more cover. Try different spots and see which one works best for you.
- Watch the wind direction and speed. The wind can affect your bullet trajectory and make it harder to hit your target. The wind direction and speed are shown by the arrow and the number on the top left corner of the screen. The longer the arrow, the stronger the wind. The wind can blow from left to right, right to left, or up or down. Adjust your aim accordingly and compensate for the wind effect.
- Watch the ski jumper's movement and timing. The ski jumper's movement and timing are shown by the bar and the circle on the bottom left corner of the screen. The bar indicates how far the jumper is from the take-off point. The circle indicates when the jumper is in the air. You need to time your shot carefully and anticipate where the jumper will be when your bullet reaches them. Aim for the head or the vital organs for more damage and points.
- Use the bullet-camera and X-Ray mode to your advantage. These features allow you to see your bullet trajectory and damage in more detail. You can activate them by pressing the spacebar or clicking the mouse button after you shoot. The bullet-camera shows you where your bullet goes and how it affects your target. The X-Ray mode shows you the internal organs and bones of your target and how they are damaged by your bullet. These features can help you improve your aim and accuracy.

With these tips and tricks, you can become a better Ski Sniper player and enjoy the game more. Have fun shooting ski jumpers on the fly with a sniper rifle!
