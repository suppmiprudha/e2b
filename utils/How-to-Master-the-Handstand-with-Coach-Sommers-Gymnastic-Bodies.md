## The Benefits of Handstands
 
Handstands are not only fun and challenging, but they also have many health and fitness benefits that you may not be aware of. Here are some of the reasons why you should do handstands every day:

1. They make you feel invincible. Holding a handstand requires a lot of mental and physical strength, and when you achieve it, you feel like you can conquer anything. Handstands can boost your confidence and self-esteem, as well as your mood[^1^].
2. They're like natural coffee. Being upside down increases the blood flow to your brain, which can have an energizing and calming effect. Handstands can also reduce the production of cortisol, the stress hormone, and help you cope with anxiety and depression[^2^] [^3^].
3. They work every muscle group. Handstands engage your whole body, especially your shoulders, arms, core and back. They can help you build muscle mass, strength and endurance in your upper body, as well as improve your posture and spinal health[^2^] [^4^].
4. They make you more mobile. Handstands require a lot of flexibility and mobility in your wrists, shoulders, hips and spine. They can help you improve your range of motion and prevent injuries by stretching and strengthening your joints and ligaments[^1^] [^4^].
5. They help with bone health, circulation and breathing. Handstands are a weight-bearing exercise, which means they put pressure on your bones and stimulate their growth. This can help prevent osteoporosis and fractures in the long term[^2^]. Handstands also improve your circulation and lymphatic system, which can help flush out toxins and waste from your cells[^5^]. Handstands can also enhance your breathing capacity by expanding your lungs and diaphragm[^4^].

As you can see, handstands have many benefits for your body and mind. They can also be a lot of fun and a great way to challenge yourself. So what are you waiting for? Start practicing handstands today and reap the rewards!
