PC-DMIS is not only a free software during the pandemic, but also a powerful and versatile software that offers many features to enhance your measurement capabilities. Here are some of the features that you can explore with PC-DMIS:
 
- QuickFeature/Auto Feature Creation: This feature allows you to create Auto Features from a single click on a CAD model without using any menu options or dialog boxes. You can also use the QuickAlign tool to create an alignment from three clicks on a CAD model.
- Xact Dimensioning: This feature enables you to create geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) features directly from the CAD model, without needing to define them manually. You can also use the XactMeasure tool to automatically select the best measurement strategy for each GD&T feature.
- Path Optimizer: This feature helps you optimize the measurement path of your routine, reducing the travel time and collisions of your probe. You can also use the Path Analyzer tool to visualize and edit the measurement path in 3D.
- Model-Based Engineering: This feature allows you to import Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) from your CAD model into PC-DMIS, saving you time and eliminating errors. You can also use the PMI Editor tool to add or modify PMI annotations in PC-DMIS.
- Change Manager: This feature helps you manage changes in your CAD model and update your measurement routine accordingly. You can also use the Change Report tool to compare different versions of your CAD model and see the impact of changes on your routine.
- Mini-Routines: This feature allows you to create reusable subroutines that can be called from multiple routines, simplifying your programming and maintenance. You can also use the Mini-Routine Manager tool to organize and edit your mini-routines.
- Auto Feature, Measurement Strategies and Measurement Strategy Editor: These features allow you to create and customize measurement strategies for different types of features, such as planes, circles, cylinders, etc. You can also use the Measurement Strategy Editor tool to modify existing strategies or create new ones.
- PC-DMIS Vision: This feature allows you to use vision sensors for non-contact measurement of 2D and 3D features. You can also use the Vision Toolbox tool to calibrate your vision system, adjust lighting and focus, and apply image processing filters.
